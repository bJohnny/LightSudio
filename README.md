	NumPad1, NumPad3, NumPad7, NumPad9

Keys to select the light. Then use the

## Known Bug

When rendering the othographic view, we achieve undesired results. By traversing, the lights in persective view will be rendered twice and ends up in way too bright picture - strangely this only occurs in the perspective and not in orthographic views. However, the orthographic viewport exists although not rendered.
